# BRICS Skills Aerial Robotics Hackathon: Autonomous Pesticide Sprayer Project

## Description

The **Autonomous Pesticide Sprayer Project** aims to develop a robust and efficient aerial robotic system designed for automated pesticide spraying in agricultural fields. The goal of the project is to provide a cost-effective, scalable, and eco-friendly solution to modernize crop protection. By leveraging drone technology and autonomous navigation systems, the project seeks to reduce manual labor, optimize pesticide use, and improve crop yield.

### Main Functions:
- **Autonomous Flight**: The drone autonomously navigates the fields based on predefined routes using GPS and real-time sensor data.
- **Pesticide Spraying**: The drone is equipped with high-precision nozzles to spray pesticides uniformly, reducing wastage.
- **Obstacle Detection**: With integrated LiDAR and camera sensors, the system avoids obstacles like trees, utility poles, or uneven terrain.
- **Remote Monitoring**: The system allows real-time monitoring and control through a mobile app, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
- **Data Collection**: It collects data on crop health, field conditions, and pesticide usage to improve future applications.
  
## Market Analysis and Target User Group
Our target users are **small-to-medium-scale farmers and agricultural enterprises** in developing countries, particularly within the BRICS nations. These users often struggle with labor shortages, high operational costs, and inefficiencies in crop protection. This drone-based solution offers them a way to enhance productivity and reduce overhead.
Currently, several aerial pesticide spraying solutions exist, including systems from companies like **DJI** and **XAG**. However, these solutions often come with high upfront costs and are not always accessible to small and medium-sized farms. Our project aims to develop a more affordable and scalable solution, specifically catering to users in developing regions. The global market for agricultural drones is expected to grow rapidly, with projections estimating a **CAGR of 21.3%** from 2021 to 2026. There is an increasing demand for automation and precision agriculture, making our solution well-positioned to tap into this market.
